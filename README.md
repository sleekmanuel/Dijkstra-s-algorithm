# Dijkstra-s-algorithm
Application of dijkstra's algorithm to a network of computers

info on test file:
first line tells number of computers
second line tells number of connections
3rd to end has 3 numbers and tells what computers are connected and time to go through connection 
eg. 3 5 20 i.e connection of computer 3 and computer 5 and it takes 20 mins to get data across.
